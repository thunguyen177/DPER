# DPER: Efficient Parameter Estimation for Randomly Missing Data

This repo contains scripts to reproduce the results in the paper:

"DPER: Efficient Parameter Estimation for Randomly Missing Data",

which is under the review.

# Usage
The notebooks are created by Google's Colaboratory and can be run online with Colab

The contents of each notebook is describe as in its title: whether there is the equal covariance matrix assumption + algorithm name(s) + dataset name for big datasets (there is no dataset name the notebook that implements on small datasets).  

<!-- [The "DPER without equal covariance assumption" notebook](https://github.com/thunguyen177/DPER/blob/main/DPER_without_equal_covariance_assumption.ipynb), ["DPER multiple class without equal covariance assumption MNIST" notebook](https://github.com/thunguyen177/DPER/blob/main/DPER_multiple_class_without_equal_covariance_assumption__MNIST.ipynb), and ["DPER multiple class without equal covariance assumption FASHION MNIST" notebook](https://github.com/thunguyen177/DPER/blob/main/DPER_multiple_class_without_equal_covariance_assumption__FASHION_MNIST.ipynb) give results in *Table 2: Parameter estimation errors without equal covariance matrices assumption.*
